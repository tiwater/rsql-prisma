<h1>RSQL -> Prisma </h1>
<p>RSQL emitter to Prisma queries for Node.js and Browsers</p>
</div>

> RSQL is a query language for parametrized filtering of entries in RESTful APIs. It’s based on FIQL
> (Feed Item Query Language) – an URI-friendly syntax for expressing filters across the entries in an Atom Feed.
> FIQL is great for use in URI; there are no unsafe characters, so URL encoding is not required. On the other side,
> FIQL’s syntax is not very intuitive and URL encoding isn’t always that big deal, so RSQL also provides a friendlier
> syntax for logical operators and some of the comparison operators.
>
> For example, you can query your resource like this: /movies?query=name=="Kill Bill";year=gt=2003 or
> /movies?query=director.lastName==Nolan and year>=2000. See examples below.
